Before we get going, you'll need the following to assemble your POLY555.

## Required

- Soldering iron and solder for electronics
- Wire stripper or cutters
- Philips and flathead screwdrivers
- Chromatic instrument tuner
- Utility knife
- School glue
- 9v battery

## Recommended

- Multimeter for debugging
- PCB vice or “helping hands” holder
- “Solder sucker” or desoldering braid
- Tweezers or “dentist’s tools” for working with small components

## Time

Give yourself plenty of time to put this together, at least a good handful of hours.

I like to spread it out throughout the day and take lots of breaks!
