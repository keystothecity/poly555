## Goal

Finish timer circuits.

:::tip

You've got this! Keep going!

This step will take the longest time, but, if you've made it this far, it should be relatively straightforward... Everything you're doing here you've already done somewhere else!

## Components

- Timer circuit \* 19
  - 100k resistor \* 1
  - 100 resistor \* 1
  - 10k resistor \* 1
  - .1uF ceramic capacitor \* 1
  - 4.7uF electrolytic capacitor \* 1
  - 10nF ceramic capacitor \* 1
  - 1k trimmer potentiometer \* 1
  - IC socket \* 1
  - 10 resistor \* 1
  - 555 timer chip \* 1

## Steps

Just like we did for the timer in [Step 3: Make Some Noise](pcb-3#steps), we'll be soldering up the remaining 19 timers.

Rather than list out all the component footprints by number, it's helpful this time to just go by location. You'll probably find that it's easiest to do them all by type; ie, solder all the resistors before moving onto caps, etc.

### It should look like this when done

## Test it

With the battery attached and power switch on, press buttons **S2** through **S20**. You should see should now hear audible tones out of the speaker!

With the battery attached and power switch on, press S2 through S20. In addition to the LED being lit, you should now hear an audible tone out of the speaker!

### Troubleshooting

- Check solder joints
- Make sure battery still has power
- Do the same troubleshooting checks you did in [Step 3: Make Some Noise](pcb-3#troubleshooting) for all the buttons and LEDs
