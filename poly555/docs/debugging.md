Stuck? Try these general debugging steps:

- Turn the boards over and check all solder joints. A majority of problems are caused by insufficient or errant soldering. Familiarize yourself with what a good joint looks like in the [Adafruit Guide To Excellent Soldering](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering)
- Using a multimeter’s voltage meter, check power at the battery, the switch, the 7805, the switches, and the IC chips. Refer to the circuit diagrams in the appendix to make sure the power is getting to the appropriate IC pins.
- If there’s buzzing, check for any metal scraps stuck to the speaker’s magnet.
- If certain notes are behaving oddly, try swapping their ICs with a known-good note.
