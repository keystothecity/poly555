Almost there! Let's finish up.

:::note
Take your time here. If the 3D-printed parts aren't fitting well together, don't force them -- you may accidentally break something.

Check for leftover support material that needs to be removed and gently carve it away with a utility knife.

## Steps

<!-- TODO: name those posts nut locks? -->

1. **Affix PCB**
   1. Slide 2 **square nuts** into the back PCB posts on the enclosure bottom half.
      ![It should look like this](https://dummyimage.com/600x400)
   2. Place the **finished PCB** into the enclosure bottom half, fitting the switch into its cavity.
   3. Fit **speaker** into its container ring. Try to hide any slack wire from the speaker _under_ the PCB.
   4. Secure PCB into place with 2 **1/4" screws** into posts's nuts. Don't overtighten!
   5. Fit **volume wheel** onto **RV21**, matching its cavity to the trim pot's shape.
2. **Add keys**
   1. Place **mounting rail** onto PCB, aligning its holes to the screw holes below
   2. Place **keys** onto **mounting rail**, matching its screw holes
3. **Finish enclosure**
   1. Place 4 **square nuts** into the nut locks on the **enclosure top**. A small dab of glue here on each is optional but will help hold the nut in place for later disassembly.
   2. Remove protective film from **plexiglass window pane** and fit it into the **enclosure top**.
   3. We're about to lock it up, so now's a good time to make sure your POLY555 is fully [tuned](tuning) and has a good battery. Oh, clean any smudges off the inside window now too.
   4. Gently align the **two enclosure halves**, fitting the back hitches on the bottom into their matching cavities on the top
   5. Turn whole enclosure over, and screw 4 **1" screws** into the four mounting rail holes. Don't overtighten!

## All Done!

Youâ€™re done!!

Take a selfie with your brand new and very incredible POLY555 synthesizer. Feel good! You're the best!!
