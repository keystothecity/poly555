The POLY555 is both simple to understand and unnecessarily complicated. It's the logical conclusion of a "555 synth". What it lacks in features and stability, it makes up for in, uh, cool factor. It's a

The POLY555 is 20 keyed, independent 555 timers, lovingly celebrated under a plexiglass window, summed into a 386 amp.

The POLY555 is a _polyphonic_, analog, square wave synth based on the _555_ timer chip.

- **Polyphonic:**​ Multiple notes can be played simultaneously. This is opposed to "monophonic," where only one note at a time can be played.
- **Analog:**​ There are no computers, microcontrollers, sound samplers, or anything digital involved. The sound you hear is the sound of a speaker being abused by discrete electronic components like capacitors and resistors and logic chips.
- **Square-wave:**​ When its output is viewed on an oscilloscope, its wave resembles a square. It’s a “hard” sounding wave type, commonly associated with chiptune music and old video games
