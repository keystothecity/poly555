:::note

If you bought the kit with the 3D-printed parts included, you can skip this part!

:::

- Designs are optimized for printing at .2mm layer height or smaller.
- Models will already be rotated to the correct position for printing.
- No external supports are needed from your slicer! The models all have any supports they'll need baked right in.
- The enclosure pieces are big and may warp off the bed plate. I use a lot of glue on the bed and stay away from plastics that shrink.

### Color changing the keys

The keys piece needs to print in two different colors to differentiate the naturals from the accidentals. To do this, set a color change at height 16.8.
