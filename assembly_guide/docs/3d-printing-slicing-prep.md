| Piece                | Layer height | Color change | Print time |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| **Enclosure top**    | .2mm         | n/a          | 4hr        |
| **Enclosure bottom** | .2mm         | n/a          | 8hr 30min  |
| **Keys**             | .2mm         | 16.8mm       | 7hr        |
| **Mounting rail**    | .2mm         | n/a          | 30min      |
| **Volume wheel**     | .2mm         | n/a          | 10min      |

**Notes:**

- Models have any supports they'll need baked right in, so you won't need to do anything extra in your slicer. They should also already be rotated to the correct position for printing.
- The enclosure pieces are big and may warp off the bed plate without good adhesion. I use a lot of glue on the bed and stay away from plastics that shrink.
