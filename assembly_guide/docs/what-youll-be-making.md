[![A finished POLY555](/img/assembly/all_done.jpg)](/img/assembly/all_done.jpg)

The POLY555 is a _polyphonic_, analog, square wave synth based on the _555_ timer chip.

- **Polyphonic:**​ Multiple notes can be played simultaneously. This is opposed to "monophonic," where only one note at a time can be played.
- **Analog:**​ There are no computers, microcontrollers, sound samplers, or anything digital involved. The sound you hear is the sound of a speaker being abused by discrete electronic components like capacitors and resistors and logic chips.
- **Square-wave:**​ When its output is viewed on an oscilloscope, its wave resembles a square. It’s a “hard” sounding wave type, commonly associated with chiptune music and old video games

:::warning
Not a toy. Choking hazard. Small parts. Not for children under 3 years.

Additionally, this kit itself has well over 200 pieces and requires a solid grasp of through-hole soldering to put together. Familiarity with basic electronics theory is great too! It's not recommended for beginners to put this together on their own.
