- Clean the plexiglass window pane with regular window cleaner.
- The trim potentiometers will hold their positions and the 555 chip is similarly resilient, but the POLY555 is an analog instrument and will lose tune over time. That's expected! Re-tune normally.
- Like arcade console buttons, the pushbuttons are mechanical and will eventually wear out over time and vigorous usage. You can try to substitute for a new pushbutton (just search for “6x6x6 tactical switch”) but may find replacing the entire SPST_VR board easier. Contact Oskitone for help.
