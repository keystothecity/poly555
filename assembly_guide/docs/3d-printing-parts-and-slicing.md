The POLY555's models are hosted on Thingiverse at [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4676728/files](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4676728/files).

Download them and then come on back here!

## Parts

There are five parts you'll need to print:

1. **Enclosure top:**
   The enclosure's top with window, speaker grill, LED cavity, and branding engraving
2. **Enclosure bottom:**
   The biggest piece! The PCB mounts onto this.
3. **Keys:**
   The piano keys. This needs to be printed in two colors, see below.
4. **Mounting rail:**
   This mounting rail piece will sit between the PCB and the keys.
5. **Volume wheel:**
   And the volume wheel fits onto a potentiometer and is exposed on the enclosure's side.

## Slicing

| Piece                | Layer height | Color change | Infill | Print time |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------ | ---------- |
| **Enclosure top**    | .2mm         | n/a          | 20%    | 4hr        |
| **Enclosure bottom** | .2mm         | n/a          | 20%    | 8hr 30min  |
| **Keys**             | .2mm         | 16.8mm       | 0%     | 4hr 30min  |
| **Mounting rail**    | .2mm         | n/a          | 20%    | 30min      |
| **Volume wheel**     | .2mm         | n/a          | 20%    | 10min      |

**Notes:**

- Models have any supports they'll need baked right in, so you won't need to do anything extra in your slicer. They should also already be rotated to the correct position for printing.
- The enclosure pieces are big and may warp off the bed plate without good adhesion. I use a lot of glue on the bed and stay away from plastics that shrink.
