<!-- TODO: get printing times -->

There are five parts you'll need to print:

1. **Enclosure top:**
   The enclosure's top with window, speaker grill, LED cavity, and branding engraving
2. **Enclosure bottom:**
   The biggest piece! The PCB mounts onto this.
3. **Keys:**
   The piano keys. This needs to be printed in two colors, see below.
4. **Mounting rail:**
   This mounting rail piece will sit between the PCB and the keys.
5. **Volume wheel:**
   And the volume wheel fits onto a potentiometer and is exposed on the enclosure's side.
